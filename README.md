This is my first repository:

I am currently learning the following commands:
1. git clone
2. git config --global user.email "Enter your email address"
3. git config --global user.name "Enter your user name"
4. You proceed to maker changes in your repository(Project)
5. git add .
6. git commit -m "This is my first commit"
7. git push

From here, every time you make changes to your repository(project), you will use the following commands
1. git add .
2. git commit -m "Enter the message: This message should be descriptive"
3. git push

git status - optional, used to check on what commands you have run and their effects on staging the changes
